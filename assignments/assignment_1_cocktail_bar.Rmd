# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv"
cocktail_data <- read_tsv(url)
View(cocktail_data)

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "<br\\s*/?>", ","))
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = ingredients %>%
           str_replace_all("<br\\s*/?>", ",") %>%
           str_replace_all("<b4\\s*/?>", ","))

library(tidyverse)

cocktail_data_long <- cocktail_data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(clean_ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

View(cocktail_data_long)

library(tidyverse)

cocktail_data_long <- cocktail_data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(clean_ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(clean_ingredients = clean_ingredients %>%
           str_remove_all("[()]") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\boz\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+\\s*/\\s*\\d+\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\s*(ml|cl|dash(?:es)?|tsp|tbsp|teaspoons?|cups?|parts?)\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?%\\s*abv\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?%\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\b") %>%
           str_squish() %>%
           str_to_lower()
         )
View(cocktail_data_long)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
cocktail_data_long_sorted <- cocktail_data_long %>%
  arrange(clean_ingredients)

View(cocktail_data_long_sorted)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

unique_ingredients_count <- cocktail_data_long %>%
  filter(!is.na(clean_ingredients) & clean_ingredients != "") %>%
  distinct(clean_ingredients) %>%
  nrow()

unique_ingredients_count
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

top_ingredients <- cocktail_data_long %>%
  filter(!is.na(clean_ingredients) & clean_ingredients != "") %>%
  count(clean_ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank <= 10)
top_ingredients

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv"
cocktail_data <- read_tsv(url)

cocktail_ingredient_counts <- cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(ingredient_count = str_count(ingredients, ",") + 1)

head(cocktail_ingredient_counts)

max_count <- max(cocktail_ingredient_counts$ingredient_count, na.rm = TRUE)

cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cocktail_ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(ingredient_count == max_count) %>%
  select(name, ingredient_count)

print(cocktails_with_most_ingredients)


```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
ingredients_long <- cocktail_data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

ingredient_counts <- ingredients_long %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients) %>%
  count(ingredients, name = "cocktail_count")

rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(cocktail_count == 1)

nrow(rare_ingredients)


```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ingredients_clean_long <- cocktail_data_long %>%
  separate_rows(clean_ingredients, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(clean_ingredients = str_trim(clean_ingredients))

ingredient_counts <- ingredients_clean_long %>%
  distinct(name, clean_ingredients) %>%
  count(clean_ingredients, name = "cocktail_count")

rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(cocktail_count == 1)

cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- ingredients_clean_long %>%
  semi_join(rare_ingredients, by = "clean_ingredients") %>%
  select(name, clean_ingredients)

cocktails_with_rare_ingredients

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  library(tidyverse)

ingredients_clean_long <- cocktail_data_long %>%
  separate_rows(clean_ingredients, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(clean_ingredients = str_trim(clean_ingredients))

ingredient_counts <- ingredients_clean_long %>%
  distinct(name, clean_ingredients) %>%
  count(clean_ingredients, name = "cocktail_count")

ingredients_with_counts <- ingredients_clean_long %>%
  left_join(ingredient_counts, by = "clean_ingredients") %>%
  mutate(is_rare = cocktail_count == 1)

cocktails_no_rare <- ingredients_with_counts %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(has_rare = any(is_rare)) %>%
  filter(!has_rare)

cocktails_no_rare$name

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
ingredients_clean_long <- cocktail_data_long %>%
  separate_rows(clean_ingredients, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(clean_ingredients = str_trim(clean_ingredients))
tab <- table(ingredients_clean_long$name, ingredients_clean_long$clean_ingredients)

matrix_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(tab) %>%
  mutate(name = rownames(.)) %>%
  select(name, everything()) %>%
  mutate(across(-name, ~ ifelse(. > 0, "X", "")))

matrix_df

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
